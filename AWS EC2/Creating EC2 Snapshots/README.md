# Creating Snapshots of EC2 Instances

This project demonstrates how to create snapshots of EC2 instances in AWS. Snapshots are backups of your Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes. They capture the exact state of the volume at the time the snapshot is taken and can be used to restore or create new volumes.

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Identify the EC2 Instance

Identify the EC2 instance for which you want to create a snapshot. Note its instance ID.

### 2. Navigate to the Amazon EC2 Console

Navigate to the Amazon EC2 console in the AWS Management Console.

### 3. Select the EC2 Instance

Select the EC2 instance for which you want to create a snapshot.

### 4. Create Snapshot

1. Right-click on the selected EC2 instance.
2. From the context menu, choose **Create Snapshot**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the snapshot.
4. Optionally, add tags to the snapshot for easier identification.
5. Click **Create Snapshot** to initiate the snapshot creation process.

### 5. Monitor Snapshot Progress

Monitor the progress of the snapshot creation process in the Amazon EC2 console. Depending on the size of the volume, it may take some time to complete.

### 6. Verify Snapshot Completion

Once the snapshot creation process is complete, verify that the snapshot appears in the list of snapshots in the Amazon EC2 console.

## Benefits

- **Data Protection**: Snapshots provide a reliable backup mechanism for your EC2 instances.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Snapshots capture the exact state of the volume at the time of snapshot creation, allowing you to restore to a specific point in time.
- **Cost-Effective**: Snapshots are cost-effective backups, as you only pay for the storage used by the snapshots.
